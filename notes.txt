### steps going forward
- review if the generated data matches the spreadsheet
  - if it doesn't, figure out what needs to be done to make that happen
- rename the misnamed stuff (melee/punch in particular)
- check that the accuracy + max_hit are being calced correctly
- check that range/magic def is being calced correctly

As errors are found, consider patching and/or upstreaming
