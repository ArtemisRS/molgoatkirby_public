### steps going forward
- review if the generated data matches the spreadsheet
  - if it doesn't, figure out what needs to be done to make that happen
- rename the misnamed stuff (melee/punch in particular)
- check that the accuracy + max_hit are being calced correctly
- check that range/magic def is being calced correctly

As errors are found, consider patching and/or upstreaming


1. Early summary
  - Deleted a bunch of irrelevant stuff to make it easier to tell what was going
   on. About 250 lines worth. Mostly other weapons and associated weapons.
  - Renamed all the melee punch bits that were reusing lance/whip etc. Along the
    way removed the modifiers that were causing them to have bonus accuracy.
  - Compared numbers produced to the ones in the spreadsheet. There are some
    differences that will need to be understood.
  - Overall the differences from my own sim seems to be primarily affected by
    the following:
    - This sim doesn't appear to handle player magic def w/rigour correctly
    - It also doesn't switch out the player defence roll to account for what
      style the player is currently using
    - nado timer is broken such that it never spawns
    - I don't take into account the final hit/death delay which is +6t.
    - I start on tick 0, not 1, which makes me off by 1t
    - I don't cover other hit delays either, but those should not have an impact
